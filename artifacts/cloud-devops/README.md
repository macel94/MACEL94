## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Cloud DevOps Engineer | Azure Platform & Release Automation Expert

With 9+ years of experience, I specialize in designing, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines. My expertise spans CI/CD, infrastructure as code, container orchestration, and platform engineering—enabling teams to deliver scalable, secure, and resilient solutions on Azure.

Currently, as an SRE at Würth-IT, I drive Azure DevOps adoption, automate deployments, and enforce governance for large-scale enterprise environments (Dynamics 365, Power Platform, Entra ID). I focus on improving developer experience, streamlining release engineering, and codifying security best practices using modern DevOps and GitOps principles.

**Core Strengths:**

- **CI/CD & Release Automation:** Architecting and maintaining robust pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) for rapid, reliable delivery across multiple environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Advanced use of Bicep and YAML to provision, configure, and manage cloud resources with repeatability and compliance.
- **Container Orchestration:** Deploying and managing containerized workloads (AKS, Helm), integrating monitoring and chaos engineering for resilient platforms.
- **Configuration Management & DevSecOps:** Automating secret rotation, RBAC, and security controls to ensure compliance and operational integrity.
- **Platform Engineering:** Enhancing developer workflows, enabling self-service infrastructure, and standardizing build systems for enterprise-scale teams.
- **Cloud Governance:** Leading stakeholder alignment and approval processes for secure, compliant cloud operations at scale.

**🎯 My Mission: To empower teams through automation, scalable infrastructure, and secure delivery pipelines—simplifying the complexity of distributed systems and accelerating innovation.**
