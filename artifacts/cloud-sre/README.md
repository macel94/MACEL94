## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Senior Site Reliability Engineer | Azure & .NET Specialist

With 9+ years in technology, I drive reliability, scalability, and operational excellence for cloud-native and distributed systems. My expertise spans end-to-end production reliability, observability, incident management, and infrastructure automation—enabling organizations to deliver resilient services at scale.

Currently, I serve as an SRE at Würth-IT, focusing on Azure-centric reliability engineering, monitoring, and automation for Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Entra ID. I thrive in complex environments, implementing SLOs/SLIs, reducing toil, and leading post-mortems to continuously improve reliability and performance.

**Key Competencies:**

- **Production Reliability:** Managing large-scale, single-tenant environments (85,000+ users, 500+ companies) with robust incident response, monitoring, and alerting practices.
- **Observability & Monitoring:** Implementing end-to-end telemetry, dashboards, and alerting using Azure, Prometheus, Grafana, and custom .NET solutions to ensure actionable insights and rapid incident detection.
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Expert in Bicep and YAML pipelines (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) for automated, repeatable, and auditable cloud infrastructure deployments.
- **Toil Reduction & Process Hardening:** Developing PowerShell and .NET automation to eliminate manual tasks, streamline operations, and improve on-call efficiency.
- **Capacity Planning & Chaos Engineering:** Load testing, performance tuning, and chaos experiments to validate system resilience and optimize resource allocation.
- **Incident Management & Post-Mortems:** Leading root cause analysis, documenting learnings, and implementing reliability improvements across teams.
- **Governance & Security:** Enforcing DevSecOps guardrails, RBAC, and compliance by default; automating secret rotation and identity security at scale.

**🎯 My Mission:** To build and operate reliable, scalable cloud platforms that empower billions. I am passionate about simplifying complex distributed systems, driving operational excellence, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

*Based in Parma, Italy. Let's connect to discuss the future of Cloud Reliability and SRE.*
