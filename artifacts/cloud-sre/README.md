## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Senior Site Reliability Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure & Observability Specialist

With 9+ years in the tech industry, I specialize in driving reliability, scalability, and operational excellence for cloud-native environments. My experience spans the full stack, from backend engineering in C#/.NET to architecting resilient Azure solutions and leading teams in automating infrastructure and incident response.

Currently, I am an SRE at Würth-IT, where I ensure production reliability for large-scale Azure, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Entra ID services. My focus is on observability, incident management, SLO/SLI/SLA implementation, and reducing operational toil through automation and robust monitoring.

**Key Competencies:**

- **Production Reliability & Incident Management:** Oversee mission-critical environments (85,000+ users, 500+ companies), implementing monitoring, alerting, and rapid incident response to minimize downtime and ensure SLA compliance.
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Expert in Bicep and YAML pipelines (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps), enabling repeatable, auditable infrastructure deployments and capacity planning.
- **Observability & Monitoring:** Design and maintain end-to-end observability stacks, integrating metrics, logs, and traces for proactive issue detection and root cause analysis.
- **Toil Reduction & On-Call Practices:** Develop automation and backend APIs to eliminate manual tasks, streamline on-call rotations, and facilitate post-mortem analysis for continuous improvement.
- **Security & Compliance Automation:** Automate identity and secret management (Key Vault), enforce RBAC, and ensure governance at scale across cloud tenants.
- **Chaos Engineering & Resilience Testing:** Advocate for and implement chaos testing and load simulations to validate system robustness under real-world conditions.

**🎯 My Mission: To build and operate reliable, scalable platforms that empower billions. I am passionate about simplifying distributed systems, elevating reliability, and driving operational excellence through SRE best practices.**
