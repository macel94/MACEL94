## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Senior DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer | Azure & .NET Specialist

With 9+ years in the tech industry, I help organizations build, secure, and scale their cloud infrastructure. My background spans the full stack—from writing C# backend code to leading development teams and architecting cloud solutions for enterprise clients.

Currently, I serve as an SRE at Würth-IT, where I focus on Azure-centric DevOps, governance, and automation across Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Entra ID services. I thrive in complex environments where operational excellence is critical.


**Key Competencies:**

- **Governance at Scale:** Navigating compliance and security in a massive single-tenant environment (85,000+ users, 500+ companies). I orchestrate stakeholders to ensure smooth approvals and operations in a complex corporate ecosystem.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Expert in Bicep and YAML pipelines (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) to implement modern, rapid approaches for creating and destroying cloud infrastructure.
- **Backend Engineering:** Strong foundation in .NET and Blazor for building robust internal tools and customer-facing apps.
- **Security Automation:** Managing large-scale secret rotation (Key Vault) and identity security standards.
- **Cloud Solutions Architecting:** Utilizing rapid prototyping to demonstrate value, align stakeholders, and drive management strategies toward modern technical directions.
- **Power Platform Administration:** Managing and governing low-code environments at an enterprise level.

**🎯 My Mission: To build groundbreaking products that influence billions. I am passionate about simplifying complex distributed systems and applying Domain-Driven Design principles to solve real-world problems.**
